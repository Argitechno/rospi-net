> # rospi-net
> ### v1.0
> A ROS 2 package for stress-testing networking on Raspberry Pi (or other platforms) by creating a configurable router node that publishes and subscribes to multiple topics.

## Features

- **Router Node:** Dynamically creates publishers and subscribers on specified topics for network stress testing.
- **Configurable:** Topics are set via ROS 2 parameters or YAML files.

## Usage

### 1. Build the workspace

```sh
cd ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

### 2. Example Parameter YAML

Create a file like `src/netstress/params/diff_rate_topics.yaml`:
```yaml
router:
  ros__parameters:
    publish_topics: ["t1", "t2", "t3", "t4", "t5"]
    subscribe_topics: ["t1", "t2", "t3", "t4", "t5"]
    publish_rates: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    default_publish_rate: 1.0
```
You can use some of the ones premade for testing.

### 3. Run the Router Node
```sh
ros2 run netstress router --ros-args --params-file <location>
```

* The node will publish messages on each topic in `talk_topics` and subscribe to each topic in `listen_topics`.
* You can monitor the logs to see message counts.

## Detailed Usage

The `router` node can be configured to publish and subscribe to multiple topics with customizable publish rates. Parameters can be passed via command line or YAML files.

### Example Parameter Configuration

```yaml
router:
  ros__parameters:
    publish_topics: ["t1", "t2", "t3", "t4", "t5"]
    subscribe_topics: ["t1", "t2", "t3", "t4", "t5"]
    publish_rates: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]                    # in Hz, matched in order to publish_topics
    default_publish_rate: 1.0                         # used if publish_rates list is shorter than publish_topics
```

### Behavior Overview

* The node publishes messages on each topic in `publish_topics` at the specified rates.
* It subscribes to each topic in `subscribe_topics`, logging received messages and total counts.
* Messages sent include an incrementing counter for tracking.
* Currentlly params while running will not affect the node.

### Sending Messages to Listen Topics

You can manually publish messages to a subscribed topic to test receiving:

```bash
ros2 topic pub 't4' std_msgs/String 'data: Test message' -r 4 -t 4
```

## Development Notes

* Only the `router` node is included; standalone listener and talker nodes have been removed.

### Future Directions

The current setup could be extended to support **virtual components** configured entirely by parameter files. For example:

* Listening to sensor topics like `left_dist_sensor_data` and `right_dist_sensor_data`.
* Publishing aggregated or processed messages (e.g., `object_position`) based on logic combining input topics.
* Introducing random variation in publish timing within configured bounds.

There are also ideas for virtual services that:

* Listen on specific topics.
* Publish results conditionally.
* Return messages based on inputs.

Achieving this modularly would require designing a configuration system capable of defining such behaviorsâ€”possibly extending beyond simple YAML to scriptable configurations.
However, it would more accurately represent a ROS-2 Development environment.

Another idea would be to have one of the PI's or an external computer run a simulated robot using something such as Gazebo, and using that to generate the messages and such that we watch.
However this is less abstract and less controllable.
